			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<div class="mission-txt-img">
				<p>
					Who doesn't love home cooking? Whether it be their mom's, dad's, sibling's, or relative's, everyone has had a dish that
					has brought their family together. We here at Mom's Kitchen love our mama's cooking and want to share it with the world.
					Not only that, we want everyone to be able to share their favorite family dishes! Here at Mom's Kitchen, we want to
					provide a platform where you can share all your favorite recipes from home. The ones that are passed down in your family,
					or ones of your own creation. We want to empower beginner and advanced home cooks to discover new recipes and record the
					ones that are special to them!
