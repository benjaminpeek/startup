			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>
				Who doesn't love home cooking? Whether it be their mom's, dad's, sibling's, or relative's, everyone has had a dish that has
				brought their family together. We here at Mom's Kitchen love our mama's cooking and want to share it with the world. Not
				only that, we want everyone to be able to share their favorite family dishes! Here at Mom's Kitchen, we want to provide a
				platform where you can share all your favorite recipes from home. The ones that are passed down in your family, or ones of
				your own creation. We want to empower beginner and advanced home cooks to discover new recipes and record the ones that are
				special to them!
