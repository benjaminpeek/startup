# CS 260 Notes
## Assignment: GitHub Notes
From this assignment, I learned how to use Git and GitHub, such as pulling, pushing, staging, and commiting. It was very interesting seeing the interaction betweeen the development environment and I am so happy I have a new skill, or at least the beginning of one!

## Assignment: Getting the server set up
This was a really interesting process! I got to experience what it's like to set up a server using AWS. I got to get my own domain name! Super fun stuff.
