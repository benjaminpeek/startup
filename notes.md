# CS 260 Notes

## Assignment: GitHub Notes

From this assignment, I learned how to use Git and GitHub, such as pulling, pushing, staging, and commiting. It was very interesting seeing the interaction betweeen the development environment and I am so happy I have a new skill, or at least the beginning of one!

## Assignment: Getting the server set up

This was a really interesting process! I got to experience what it's like to set up a server using AWS. I got to get my own domain name! Super fun stuff.

## Using Caddy to make my site secure

This was one of the coolest experiences so far. Learning how to get into Caddy using the Terminal and making my site secure using Caddy was awesome, and it is super neat seeing my name in a URL!

## HTML: structure

It was fun seeing my own elements that I added to the CodePen come to life!
