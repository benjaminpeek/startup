# CS 260 Notes

## Assignment: GitHub Notes

From this assignment, I learned how to use Git and GitHub, such as pulling, pushing, staging, and commiting. It was very interesting seeing the interaction betweeen the development environment and I am so happy I have a new skill, or at least the beginning of one!

## Assignment: Getting the server set up

This was a really interesting process! I got to experience what it's like to set up a server using AWS. I got to get my own domain name! Super fun stuff.

## Using Caddy to make my site secure

This was one of the coolest experiences so far. Learning how to get into Caddy using the Terminal and making my site secure using Caddy was awesome, and it is super neat seeing my name in a URL!

## HTML: structure

It was fun seeing my own elements that I added to the CodePen come to life!

For this deliverable, I made a few edits on the Simon CSS page given to us.

- **Changed colors of Simon game** Changed the background color to white, and the colors of the buttons.
- **Changed picture on About page** Changed it to an abstract painting I found online, copyright free.
- **Changed all pages header text to reflect the site was modified by me** "modified by Ben Peek!"
- **Changed the color of the border of picture on About page to aquamarine**
- **Changed table header color on Scores page to white**
